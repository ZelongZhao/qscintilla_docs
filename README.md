Documentation for QScintilla editing component of the PyQt framework.
<br>If there are mistakes, please open an issue on it.
<br>If there is functionality that is not documented, open an issue and if I know anything about it, I will gladly add it.

**Kristof Mulier** also adapted the documentation into a great website at **https://qscintilla.com/**
<a href="https://qscintilla.com"><img src="https://qscintilla.com/figures/intro/logo_qscintilla.png" align="left" width="64" height="64"></a>. 
<br>It is prefered you use Kristof's website, as it is much easier to navigate and honestly better.
